# Changelog

All notable changes to **superhuman** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The `version` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` must always match the latest released version here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Automated patch releases on merge (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).** Every push to `main` now cuts a release: an ordinary merge auto-bumps the patch version across all three manifests, promotes the `## [Unreleased]` CHANGELOG section into a dated section, commits the bump back to `main`, then tags and publishes the GitHub Release. A merge that already carries a new version (a manual minor/major bump) is released as-is instead of being patched past. The version-writing + CHANGELOG promotion is extracted to `scripts/release/prepare_release.sh` (covered by `tests/scripts/test_prepare_release.sh`). Replaces `release-tag.yml`, which only tagged manual bumps. Bump commits use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so they do not retrigger the workflow.
- **One-command installer (`install.sh`).** Installs superhuman **and its dependent plugins** — `superpowers` (required) and `everything-claude-code` / ECC (recommended) — in a single command via the Claude Code CLI (`claude plugin marketplace add` / `plugin install`). Idempotent and re-runnable; checks prerequisites (`git`/`gh`/`jq`/`python3` + `gh auth`), and falls back to printing the manual slash-commands when the `claude` CLI isn't on `PATH`. Flags: `--skip-ecc`, `--codex` (clone + symlink the Codex skill), `--dry-run`. Usage: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaurav0107/superhuman/main/install.sh | bash`. Covered by `tests/scripts/test_install.sh`; README **Installation** section leads with it.

### Fixed
- **Installer used the wrong marketplace/plugin IDs**, so both dependency installs failed (`Plugin "superpowers" not found in marketplace "superpowers"`, and likewise for ECC). The marketplace name comes from each repo's `marketplace.json`, not the repo slug. Corrected to the verified IDs: `superpowers@superpowers-marketplace` (via `obra/superpowers-marketplace`) and `ecc@ecc` (via `affaan-m/everything-claude-code`). Added a bare-plugin-name retry so a future marketplace rename self-heals instead of hard-failing. README manual commands updated to match.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Usage & lifecycle telemetry.** Two new opt-out PostHog events extend adoption measurement beyond terminal contribution outcomes, governed by the same single opt-out gate (`SUPERHUMAN_TELEMETRY=off` / `telemetry.json` / `print`):
  - **`superhuman_used`** — emitted (backgrounded, non-blocking) on every command invocation, carrying `command` and `version`. All five commands (`contribute`, `contribute-loop`, `contribution-dashboard`, `contribution-fleet`, `repo-finder`) are instrumented.
  - **`superhuman_lifecycle`** — emitted once after install or a version change (`kind` = `install`|`update`, plus `version`, `prev_version`), inferred from a cached `~/.superhuman/global/last_version.json` since Claude Code plugins have no native installer hook.
  - **`scripts/lib/telemetry_common.sh`** — shared, sourced opt-out/identity/version/send helpers; `usage_ping.sh` refactored to source it (behavior parity), new `usage_event.sh` emits the two events.
- Payload remains minimal (`distinct_id` = GitHub username only); `TELEMETRY.md` documents all three events.

### Fixed
- `usage_event.sh` no longer writes the lifecycle cache in `SUPERHUMAN_TELEMETRY=print` (dry-run) mode, so previewing telemetry no longer consumes the one-shot install/update signal.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **PR-body attribution is now rogue-proof — the canonical footer is the single source of truth.** `scripts/orchestrator/pr_body_with_attribution.sh` now *scrubs* any model-authored attribution line from the PR body before appending the deterministic `🤖 Opened with [Superhuman](…)` footer (or, with `SUPERHUMAN_ATTRIBUTION=off`, emitting the scrubbed body with no footer). This prevents a model-improvised, unlinked, fine-print disclosure line (or double attribution) from replacing the canonical linked footer. Scrubbing is scoped to the **footer zone** (after the last `---`, else the trailing paragraph, else the final line) and gated on a structural signal, so legitimate mid-body prose is never touched. The same pass also strips Claude/AI attribution (`🤖 Generated with…`, `Co-authored-by:`, `noreply@anthropic.com`) from the PR body, closing a gap where those were guarded only in commit messages. `agents/planner.md` gains a matching defense-in-depth rule: never author attribution in the PR body — the harness owns the canonical footer.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-05

> First tagged release since `v0.5.1`. The interim `0.7.0` / `0.7.1` / `0.8.0` version bumps were manifest-only and never tagged, so their changes are consolidated into this release.

### Added
- **Learning substrate — the system now learns from reviewer feedback instead of repeating it.** A durable, typed knowledge base that outlives a single run and generalizes across repos, closing a Birth → Retrieve → Prevent → Enforce → Curate loop so the same review comments stop recurring across merged PRs.
  - **`lesson-distiller` agent** (producer/curator; sole owner of the knowledge base). *Seed mode* authors a short repo architecture **dossier** grounded in a deterministic structural scan, and emits deterministic scan **rule cards**. *Curate mode* mines a run's classified reviewer comments and merge outcome into typed rule cards, then runs graduated cross-repo promotion, age-based decay, contradiction-demotion, demoted→active re-confirmation, and maintainer-reraise regression logging.
  - **Rule cards** (`schemas/rule_card.schema.json`) — typed, provenance-tracked convention records. Deterministic cards reference one of a fixed check registry (`file_present`, `file_in_dir`, `commit_matches`, `identifier_case`); semantic cards carry prose the scorer's LLM pass judges. A card is DATA — no executable field — and a mined `check.id` outside the registry is force-converted to semantic.
  - **PREVENT** — `planner` and `builder` retrieve the dossier + matching cards (`select_lessons.sh`) and inject them as MUST-follow conventions (planner's Compliance checklist; builder's subagent-driven-development constraints).
  - **ENFORCE** — `merge-probability-scorer` runs `check_lessons.sh` on the diff; an unfixed ENFORCED violation caps the merge score at 75% (blocks merge-ready ≥80%) and lists the rule under Blocking Issues. Shipped violations are logged to a cross-repo regression corpus at terminal only.
  - **Graduated cross-repo promotion** — a repo-scoped rule recurring across ≥2 distinct repos becomes a `global-candidate`; ≥3 graduates it to enforced `global` scope.
  - **Scripts** (all unit-tested, bash-3.2-safe): `scripts/lessons/{select_lessons,check_lessons,merge_cards,promote_lessons,decay_lessons,record_regression,set_lesson_status}.sh`; `scripts/profiler/{scan_structure,write_repo_scan,dossier_fresh}.sh`; `scripts/lib/lesson_checks.sh` (fixed check registry + canonical dedupe key).
  - **Observability** — `/contribution-dashboard` gains a Learning panel: per-repo rule-card counts (total / active / enforced / by kind, plus demoted) and dossier freshness, and a global section with promoted cards (candidate vs. enforced) and the regression alarm log.
- **New shared-state files** (registered in `agents/SHARED_STATE.md`): `repo_scan.json` (owner repo-profiler); `dossier.md`, `dossier_meta.json`, `lessons.jsonl`, `lessons_global.jsonl`, `lesson_regressions.jsonl` (owner lesson-distiller); `classified_comments.json` (owner resolve-comments — the distiller handoff). Each with a draft 2020-12 schema where applicable.
- **PR-origin disclosure.** `scripts/orchestrator/pr_body_with_attribution.sh` assembles the PR body and appends a Superhuman origin-disclosure footer, honoring `SUPERHUMAN_ATTRIBUTION`. Unit-tested by `tests/scripts/test_pr_body_with_attribution.sh`; `agents/opensource-contributor.md` Phase 6 pipes the plan-derived body through it before `gh pr create`.
- **Codex runtime support.** `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and `skills/superhuman/SKILL.md` adapter expose the full contribution workflow to Codex, executing the same `agents/`, `scripts/`, `schemas/` contracts inline instead of via subagent dispatch. Includes concrete `superpowers:` fallback procedures, a Codex command-equivalent table in the README, and clone + symlink install instructions.

### Changed
- `repo-profiler` now publishes `repo_scan.json` (deterministic structural scan of the worktree) to ground the dossier.
- `resolve-comments` persists classified, non-suspicious comments to `classified_comments.json` for the distiller.
- `opensource-contributor` sequences the distiller: `MODE=seed` after profiling (Phase 2.5) and `MODE=curate` post-terminal (Phase 8.5) — both non-fatal.
- `skills/superhuman/SKILL.md` gained the learning-substrate safety rail for the Codex runtime.
- **PRs now disclose their Superhuman origin by default** — a one-line footer on the **PR body** (`🤖 Opened with [Superhuman](https://github.com/gaurav0107/superhuman), an open-source contribution agent.`). Set `SUPERHUMAN_ATTRIBUTION=off` (also `false`/`0`/`no`) to suppress it.
- **Contributor identity is derived from `gh`, not hard-coded** (`agents/builder.md` Step 3, `agents/opensource-contributor.md` Phase 0). Whoever installs the plugin contributes under their own name; falls back to the `ID+login@users.noreply.github.com` privacy address when GitHub hides the email. Both agents guard with `gh auth status` and surface `GH_AUTH_MISSING`.
- **The single-author commit rule is unchanged and now explicitly commit-scoped.** Commits carry no `Co-Authored-By:` trailers and no AI attribution (pre-push verifier enforces it); the disclosure lives only in the PR body.
- Plugin description and keywords updated across the three manifests to reflect dual-runtime (Claude Code + Codex) support.

### Security
- Reviewer comments feeding the distiller are treated as EXTERNAL_CONTENT; the distiller extracts ONLY into the constrained rule-card schema. A comment attempting a command, URL, or out-of-repo write is classified `suspicious`, logged to `mistakes.md`, and never minted into a card. Enforced rules feed the scorer's judgment only — they can never expand `allowed_commands.json` or drive builder shell. The active↔demoted transition routes exclusively through `set_lesson_status.sh`; `merge_cards.sh` refuses status-flips-via-merge, so a crafted comment cannot flip an enforced rule by re-merging it.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Orchestrator could not dispatch.** The Claude Code harness does not grant the `Agent` tool to spawned subagents, so `opensource-contributor` running as a subagent could never fan out to specialists. The orchestrator now executes each specialist contract **inline** — it reads the specialist `.md` and follows it itself — and records `mode: "inline"` in run telemetry. `dispatched` mode is reserved for a future top-level slash-command orchestrator.
- **Manifest drift.** `marketplace.json` had been left at `0.4.1` since v0.5.0 shipped; it is now re-synced with `plugin.json`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-18

### Changed
- **Bash extracted from agent prompts into versioned `scripts/`.** Inline `bash`/`jq` was the bulk of every prompt; moving it out shrinks per-phase load and makes the logic unit-testable. Safety prose (single-author rule, force-with-lease, suspicious-halt) intentionally stays inline in the prompts. Hard constraint for this release: lose no behavior.
- **JSON Schemas formalised under `schemas/`.** Every shared-state file now has a draft 2020-12 schema, validated at write time.

### Added
- Loop primitive commands: `/contribute`, `/repo-finder`, `/contribute-loop`.
- Bash unit-test suite under `tests/scripts/` covering `scripts/` and every schema.

## [0.4.1] — 2026

### Changed
- Declared plugin dependencies (`superpowers` required, `everything-claude-code` recommended) in `plugin.json` under `requires.plugins`.
- Dropped hard-coded `gstack` paths.
- Rewrote the README for public consumption.

## [0.4.0] — 2026

### Added
- `merge-probability-scorer` historical-signal predictor (blends a 10-dimension rubric with past merge outcomes).
- `impact-auditor` agent — refactor blast-radius auditor that blocks reviewer-suggested refactors which break one caller to fix another.
- `/contribution-fleet` parallel run launcher with per-run state isolation and a `flock(2)` mutex.
- Smoke gate in `builder`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026

### Changed
- Hardened the contributor agent — tightened phase sequencing, iteration caps, and merge-threshold handling.

## [0.2.4] — 2026

### Fixed
- Dashboard now runs on macOS's default bash 3.2.

### Added
- Reputation state surfaced in `/contribution-dashboard`.

## [0.2.3] — 2026

### Added
- Reputation gate: repos that consistently reject or ignore PRs land in a cooldown and are skipped by `repo-finder`.

### Changed
- Migrated all persistent state to `~/.superhuman/`.

## [0.2.2] — 2026

### Changed
- Hard-coded the single-author commit rule; forbids `Co-Authored-By:` / AI-attribution trailers. Every commit is authored by the human contributor identity.

## [0.2.0] — 2026

### Changed
- Version bump to trigger plugin cache refresh.

## [0.0.1-beta] — 2026

### Added
- Initial release: orchestrator plus specialist agents for autonomous open-source contribution.
