# Stage-A issue triage filter (repo-finder Step 4).
#
# Reads the bulk `gh issue list` payload and decides, with no further API calls,
# which issues are worth ranking. Emits, per issue that clears the age and
# triage-signal gates:
#
#   {"verdict":"KEEP","number":N,"title":"…","labels":["bug"],"body":"…",
#    "createdAt":"ISO8601","maintainer_commented":bool,
#    "maintainer_comment_assoc":bool,"last_maintainer_comment":"ISO8601"|null}
#   {"verdict":"SKIP","number":N,"reason":"..."}
#
# A KEEP row carries the issue payload: the Step-4 rubric scores
# title/labels/body/createdAt and may not re-fetch them.
#
# Issues that fail those two gates produce no output at all — they are not
# candidates. Everything past them earns an explicit SKIP with a reason, because
# the decline/claimed tests match prose and a heuristic you cannot watch misfire
# is one you cannot tune.
#
# Exit: 0 ok, 10 config error (never a verdict — a config error applies to every
# issue equally, and wearing a verdict's exit code would empty the candidate set
# while looking like a clean run).
